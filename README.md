# Yanzi

Managed Intent for AI-assisted development.

## What It Is

Yanzi preserves the reasoning behind AI-generated decisions.
It captures, verifies, and chains intent so teams can restore trust and continuity.

## Install (Coming Soon)

Installation instructions will be added here.
Prebuilt binaries will be available.
For development builds, see the Yanzi CLI repo: `https://github.com/chuxorg/yanzi-cli`.

## Quick Example

AI -> emitter -> library -> verify

## Repositories

- Yanzi Library (append-only intent ledger)
- Yanzi CLI (user interface)
- Yanzi Emitter (integration sidecar)

## Philosophy

Small. Composable. Verifiable.
No AI logic. No orchestration. Just memory.
